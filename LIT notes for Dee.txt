Hi Dee 

- I've been playing around with LIT yesterday & today and have added to their sample index.html a few of their other methods. Please see the zipped file attached.

I hope this can give you a head start on messing with this tool. The methods below are all in the index.html in the zip file. You'll need "npm install lit"

I sent a few other points about working with this tool on the team's discord channel - limitations and the URL to the SDK, which is fairly well written.Here's the SDK again
https://lit-protocol.github.io/lit-js-sdk/api_docs_html/index.html

Talk to you soon. I will be on Discord for most of the day - let me know when you plan to be in the Castle, the Art hotel or where ever. Castle is open - upper floors are quieter
