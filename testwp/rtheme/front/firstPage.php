            <div class='box'>Rachel Dinda (dreamscape_r) has captivated audiences with murals and paintings across the
                US and internationally. Beyond her creative expression, Rachel is most passionate to serve communities
                and boost awareness for female muralists, education, mental health. She has donated art and time for
                organizations such as Awall Mural Projects, Weigh-Out Ministries, and Linked4Life, and more. Inspired by
                nature, adventure, as well as philosophical and existential topics, her works often have a cadence of
                compassion, personification of emotion, and an endangered 2000s angst.</div>
